Usage: transfer file on your Mac to the VM

## How to use

1. Change the `filename` in  “keystroke.py” as the filename that you want to transfer.
2. Type `python3 keystroke.py` on terminal (same path as the two files).
3. Switch to the VM, with an open IDE (it will start typint after 3 seconds, you can set your own time in the python file).

## Notes:

1. You will lose control of your computer when it start typing. So if you do not switch to the IDE you want to use in 3 seconds, it will stuck or type it to some other places (just wait for end).
2. You may need to adjust the setting of your IDE to make sure the same file will be shown. For example, “insert paired brackets” in Clion should be closed. 



## Issues

1. Indent problem: I use Clion and it has auto indent, so all the spaces before each line are removed as it will show automatically. 

2. The code is typed charater by character, quite time consuming.
